\title{experdyn: Experiential Dynamics for ESM Time Series}
\description{
\strong{experdyn} provides a growing toolkit for applying nonlinear dynamics and
complexity science to behavioral time series from Experience Sampling Method
(ESM) / Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies.
\subsection{What is an ESM study?}{

Participants receive repeated notifications throughout the day (e.g., every
1-3 hours) and respond to short questionnaires about their current mood,
activity, or psychological state. The resulting data are inherently
\strong{irregularly sampled} multivariate time series — one series per participant.
}

\subsection{What does experdyn offer?}{

The package is organised around three main themes:

\describe{
\item{Preprocessing}{Regularise and clean raw ESM time series before
analysis. Key function: \code{resample_timeseries()}.}
\item{State-space methods}{Reconstruct the attractor of a dynamical system
via delay-based embedding (Takens' theorem).}
\item{Complexity measures}{Compute entropy, fractal dimensions, recurrence
quantification analysis, and related indices that capture the nonlinear
temporal structure of psychological dynamics.}
}
