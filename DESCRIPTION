Description: Provides tools for preprocessing and analysing behavioral time series
    collected via Experience Sampling Method (ESM) paradigms. The package
    implements nonlinear dynamics and complexity measures — including entropy,
    fractal dimensions, and state-space embeddings — to characterise the temporal
    structure of psychological and behavioral data from repeated-measures,
    ecological momentary assessment designs.
